/// If a step searcher doesn't rely on this class, it'll be <see langword="true"/> for the property named
/// <see cref="StepSearcherOptionsAttribute.IsDirect"/>.
/// If you find that the step searcher marks that attribute,
/// you can call it everywhere safely; however, if the searcher isn't marked that attribute, you
/// can't call it everywhere unless you call the method <see cref="InitializeMaps"/>.

/// Please note, all names of properties in this class can also be found in <see cref="Grid"/>,
/// which means you can also call the property by <see cref="Grid"/>. Of course, some of them
/// doesn't contain the same one in <see cref="Grid"/>, but you can find a same property whose
/// execution logic (handling logic) is totally same.
/// For example, <see cref="EmptyMap"/> is same as <see cref="Grid.EmptyCells"/>. The difference
/// between them is that you shouldn't use <see cref="EmptyMap"/> until you have called
/// <see cref="InitializeMaps"/>, while <see cref="Grid.EmptyCells"/> can be used
/// everywhere, because it isn't an instant property (which means the calculation begins
/// when you called them, i.e. lazy ones; in contrast, some properties only store values directly,
/// so their values can be got instantly, i.e. instant ones).
