	/// <code><![CDATA["{Name}: Cells {CellsStr} => {ElimsStr}"]]></code>
	/// Here the string result <b>shouldn't</b> be with the leading <c>'$'</c> character, because this is a
	/// format string instead of an interpolated one.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Here the property <c>Name</c>, <c>CellsStr</c> and <c>ElimsStr</c> must have been implemented before
	/// the property invoked. You should create 3 properties whose names are <c>Name</c>, <c>CellsStr</c>
	/// and <c>ElimsStr</c>, and return the corresponding correct string result,
	/// making them non-<see langword="public"/> (suggested keyword is <see langword="internal"/>)
	/// and applying attribute <see cref="FormatItemAttribute"/> to it.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The recommended implementation pattern is:
	/// <code><![CDATA[
	/// [FormatItem]
	/// internal string CellsStr
	/// {
	///     [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
	///	    get => Cells.ToString();

	/// You can use the code snippet <c>fitem</c> to create the pattern, whose corresponding file is added
	/// into the <c>optional/vssnippets</c> folder. For more information, please open the markdown file
